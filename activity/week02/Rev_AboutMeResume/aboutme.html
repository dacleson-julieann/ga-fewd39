			<img src="Betty-White.jpg" alt="Betty-White">
			The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and
			one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house
			is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by
			fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak
			(Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin
			board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a
			gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5]
			The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo
			(Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady
			Pines, burned down.
