		<p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and
		one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house
		is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by
		fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak
		(Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin
		board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a
		gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5]
		The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo
		(Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady
		Pines, burned down.</p>
